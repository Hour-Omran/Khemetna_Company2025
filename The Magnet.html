    <h2>Title: The Magnet </h2>
        <h2>Author: ---- Not Specified</h2>
        <h2>Summary of the Book:</h2>

        <h3>    The magnet was historically known as the "mineral stone," a unique type of black stone that differs from other types of stones because it can attract small pieces of iron. Magnets come in various shapes; some are shaped like a horseshoe, while others are flat bars. The strength of a magnet does not depend on its size; in fact, as the size increases, its ability to attract a large number of ferromagnetic materials decreases. The pole of the magnet that points north is called the north pole, while the other pole is referred to as the south pole. Like poles repel each other, while opposite poles attract. A magnet loses its magnetic properties when struck or heated. Magnets are used in children's toys, educational tools, and for attaching advertisements to bulletin boards. The magnetic compass is used in airplanes and ships to determine directions.</h3>

        <h3>Quote: Perhaps the most astonishing aspect of magnetism is that we live on the surface of a giant magnetâ€”the Earth. The Earth has two magnetic poles, north and south, just like an ordinary magnet.</h3>
