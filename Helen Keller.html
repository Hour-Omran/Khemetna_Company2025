    <h2>Title:Helen Keller</h2>
        <h2>Author: Mohammed Kamel Hassa (Lawyer)</h2>
        <h2>Summary of the Book:</h2>
       <h3>Helen Keller was born into a caring family. Her father worked as a detective and managed a small farm, while her mother was affectionate and loved children. At 19 months old, Helen contracted diphtheria, leaving her unable to see, hear, or speak. Despite her disabilities, she displayed remarkable intelligence and communicated through touch, smell, and unique symbols she invented.

        Using Braille, she pursued her education. Her father sought help from Alexander Graham Bell, who directed them to Anne Sullivan. Anne taught Helen letters, words, and helped translate university texts not available in Braille. After 30 years of companionship, Anne passed away, but Helen's resilience carried her forward. Polly Thompson succeeded Anne as Helen’s assistant until Helen’s death at the age of 88.
