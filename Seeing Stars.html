    <h2>Title:Seeing Stars</h2>
        <h2>Author:Rosanna Hansen</h2>
        <h2>Summary of the Book:</h2>
<h3>Stars are massive balls of flaming gases, emitting intense heat. Over time, people have created stories around constellationsâ€”patterns formed by star clusters. These stories helped ancient civilizations recognize stars and navigate using their positions. Constellations also assisted in tracking seasons as they moved across the sky.

    Greek mythology features many constellations, such as Ursa Major (The Great Bear), visible year-round. The Milky Way, a spiral galaxy, contains over 100 billion stars. Our solar system revolves around the galaxy, completing an orbit approximately every 250 million years.</h3>

    <h3>Quote:"Stars look like little bright lights. They appear small because they are so far away. They shine because we see them through the air surrounding the Earth."</h3>
