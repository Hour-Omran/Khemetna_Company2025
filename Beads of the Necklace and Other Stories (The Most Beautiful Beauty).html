    <h2>Title: Beads of the Necklace and Other Stories (The Most Beautiful Beauty)</h2>
        <h2>Author: Dr. Ali Abdul Moneim Abdul Hamid</h2>
        <h2>Summary of the Book:</h2>
        <h3>    Once upon a time, there was a girl named Athma Al-Bajaliyah who was smart and clever. She had a people who sought her advice, and a sister named Khod who was blessed by Allah with stunning beauty and charm. One day, seven brothers from the Azd tribe came, dressed in fine clothes, all wanting to marry Khod. They asked Khod's guardian about the qualities of the men, and she described them one by one. After that, Khod sought advice from her sister, but she did not listen to her and married a young man named Mudrik, whom the guardian had described as strong and brave.
            On their way back to their homeland with Khod, they were ambushed by men from the Kinana tribe, who fled and left the women and wealth as spoils for the Kinana tribe. While Khod was walking with the men of the Kinana tribe, tears streamed down her cheeks. One of them asked her why she was crying, and she told him her story. A strong man, who was not handsome, named Abu Nawas, approached her. When she inquired about him, they told her he was strong and had vowed to protect her, so she married him and accepted him as her husband.</h3>
<br>
            <h3>Quote: "Marry, O Khod, a man from your people, who knows your worth and elevates your status, and do not be deceived by appearances and bodies."</h3>
