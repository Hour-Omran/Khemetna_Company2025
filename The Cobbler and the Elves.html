        <h2>Summary of the Book:</h2>
<h3>A long time ago, a cobbler and his wife made their living crafting shoes, though they were always poor. One day, they had only one piece of leather left, enough to make two pairs of shoes. The cobbler cut the leather and closed his shop for the night. To his surprise, the next morning, he found two beautiful pairs of shoes on his workbench. This mysterious help continued every night, and the cobbler grew wealthy.

    Curious to discover who was assisting them, the cobbler and his wife decided to stay up late. They placed a piece of leather on the table and hid behind the curtains. At midnight, two tiny elves wearing tattered clothes jumped through the window and began working diligently until dawn. By morning, the elves were gone, leaving behind beautifully crafted shoes.
    
    Moved by gratitude, the cobbler and his wife decided to repay the elves. The cobbler made them tiny shoes, while his wife sewed them small jackets, trousers, and caps. They left the gifts on the table and hid behind the curtains. At midnight, the elves returned and, upon seeing the clothes, clapped their hands with joy. They quickly dressed, danced around the shop, and disappeared out the window, never to return.</h3>
