    <h2>Title:Parents’ Meeting</h2>
        <h2>Author:Dew Eater, Kora Jan</h2>
        <h2>Summary of the Book:</h2>
<h3>Reem, a seventh-grade student, took on the ambitious task of organizing a parents’ meeting. She proposed innovative ideas like distributing tissues, giving gifts to families, and hosting a choir to sing happy wishes. While some of her ideas were approved, the event didn't go as planned. The school became chaotic, and police were called to handle the disruption.

    Despite the challenges, Reem and her peers worked to resolve the situation. They implemented a new plan to email grades to parents instead of holding another meeting. The story highlights the creativity and determination of students in managing unexpected challenges.</h3>

    <h3>Quote:"When I grow up, I will invent text messages that return when we call them. If someone regrets a message they sent, they should be able to call it back."</h3>
