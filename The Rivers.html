    <h2>Title: The Rivers</h2>
        <h2>Author: Butterfly Books / Lebanon Library</h2>
        <h2>Summary of the Book:</h2>
       <h3>Rivers play a significant role in our lives as they provide us with water and food. Most rivers begin to form in the high mountains where rain falls and snow melts, causing water to gather and flow down the slopes. Rivers also make life easier for humans; in ancient times, people built cities along riverbanks and used rivers as a means of transportation, which was easier than navigating rough, unpaved land before roads were constructed. Bridges are used to cross rivers, and there are many types of bridges; some are movable, allowing ships to pass underneath.
        Rivers are still used for travel and shipping goods; some are deep enough for large ships to navigate, like the Yangtze River in China. In hot countries like Egypt, farmers use river water to irrigate their crops, and sometimes they dig special canals to connect rivers to fields. In Syria, there are large waterwheels called "noria" that were used to lift water from the river and distribute it to cities and fields.
    </h3>

    <h3>Quote: "The wide valleys formed by rivers have rich soil, making them suitable for agriculture."</h3>
