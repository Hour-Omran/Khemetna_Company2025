    <h2>Title: Beads of the Necklace and Other Stories (Habāt al-‘Aqd)</h2>
        <h2>Author: Dr. Ali Abdel Moneim Abdel Hamid</h2>
        <h2>Summary of the Book:</h2>
        <h3>On the day of Eid al-Adha during the caliphate of Ali ibn Abi Talib, Muslims donned their finest clothes. After leading the Eid prayer, Ali ibn Abi Talib returned home, where his daughter greeted him with joy and excitement. Noticing a necklace adorning her neck, he asked where it came from. She explained that she had borrowed it from the treasury to adorn herself for the celebration and intended to return it afterward.
            Ali summoned the treasurer and questioned him, “Have you betrayed the trust?” The treasurer denied any wrongdoing, explaining that Ali’s daughter had asked to borrow the necklace for three days, with the intention of returning it. Ali immediately ordered the necklace to be returned to its rightful place in the treasury.
            He then declared, “If my daughter had taken the necklace from the treasury without making it clear that it was a borrowed and guaranteed item to be returned, she would have been the first Hashemite woman to have her hand cut off for theft!” His daughter, humbled and ashamed, responded, “Father, I am your daughter, a part of you. Who deserves it more than I?” Ali replied, “Can every woman among the Muslims wear such a necklace on Eid? Are you anything more than one among them, my daughter?</h3>
