    <h2>Title:Hawk’s Eye Puzzle</h2>
        <h2>Author:Taghreed Arif Al-Najjar</h2>
        <h2>Summary of the Book:</h2>
       <h3>his novel tells the story of Ziad, a young Palestinian man struggling with poverty and the imprisonment of his father. Forced to leave school, Ziad worked at the Qalandia checkpoint, selling tea. His mother engaged in volunteer work, comforting families of prisoners and the deceased. His grandmother, who lived with them, often told stories of their lost treasures and the expulsion from their village.

        Despite hardships, Ziad and his sister Najwa teamed up to search for the molten gold their grandmother spoke of, aiming to return it to its rightful owners. Alongside their quest, they faced challenges: Najwa continued her studies, their younger brother Yousef suffered from a serious illness, and their father endured prison. The story intertwines loss, hope, and perseverance as they navigate their lives.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>Quote: "May God have mercy on your grandma. She told us about the gold, but we didn’t understand her. We thought she was suffering from dementia"</h3>
