        Rana's Story: A Palestinian Girl Who Lost So Much
        Rana, the eight-year-old Palestinian girl, lived in a village in Palestine. She loved school and life, played with her friends, and learned something new every day. But one day, the occupying forces invaded her village and destroyed her home and school. Rana lost her friends, her home, and more importantly: she lost her ability to learn after her school was destroyed.
        Like Rana, many children have lost their chance to learn and live in peace. With your help, we can provide support to restore their lives and futures. Donate now and be part of the hope.
        On some days, she would sit with her mother, wishing to return to school and fulfill her dream of becoming a teacher. But the war made her realize that hope was her only weapon. Despite all the difficulties, she continued to learn what she could at home, holding onto her dream of a better future despite all she had lost.</p>
